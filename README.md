# sequential-auction-replication

This project is an SMM estimation of a sequential auction model (Postel-Viany and Robin, 2002). I used Julia to replicate the Matlab code posted on Postel-Vinay's website: https://sites.google.com/site/fabienpostelvinay/teaching?authuser=0.

"simulation.jl" is the main file to run.
